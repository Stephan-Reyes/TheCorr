							<h2>FEATURED PROJECTS</h2>

                <img src="img/portfolio/boxedWater.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="The food packaging goal is to recycle paper cups and foodservice packaging into valuable, high-quality materials.
                Every year, 5.7 million tons of paper, prepared food packaging is landfilled in the United States.
                The collection of recycling this material would decrease greenhouse gas emissions by -15 million mtCO2e, equivalent to removing 3 million passenger vehicles from the road.</a><br><h4>Success Stories</h4><br>
                <p>RUNNING TOWARD RECYCLING: Largest Cross Country Meet in the U.S. Partners with Global Green USA to Pilot Paper Cup Recycling Initiative; Reduce CO2 Emissions<br><br>September 1, 2015 (Los Angeles, CA) — National environmental non-profit Global Green USA is teaming up with the largest cross country meet in the United States,
                the Portage Invite in Portage, Michigan, to put recyclable paper cups to the test, both for performance and for recyclability at a local paper mill. Using cups developed by Coalition for Resource Recovery (CoRR) member LBP Manufacturing that have passed a recyclability protocol developed by CoRR member Western Michigan University (WMU), Global Green USA will coordinate their use, collection and recycling at a paper mill in Kalamazoo, MI operated by Graphic Packaging.</p><br><img src='http://www.thecorr.org/Road%20Race%20Cups%20Graphic.jpg' style='width:400px;margin-left:35px;'><br><br><p>The successful recovery and recycling of these cups will represent a key step in identifying best systems for keeping valuable paper fiber in the market as high-quality products, and out of landfills. Unlike many other paper sources, such as newsprint and magazines, foodservice packaging is a growing stream but seldom recovered for recycling. According to the EPA, 5.6 million tons of food service packaging is landfilled in the US each year, releasing greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to six coal-fired power plants. Since 2009, Global Green’s Coalition for Resource Recovery (CoRR) program has been working to divert these valuable materials into new products.

With over 830,000 lunch trays sent to landfill each school day in NYC, the challenge is: Can we transform trays currently made from unrecoverable expanded polystyrene foam into aesthetically pleasing, functional, recyclable, and compostable lunch trays? <a href='https://www.globalgreen.org/blog/'>Read more</a></p>
                <h5>Tour of United Corrstack Pulp Mill in Reading, PA</h5><p>CoRR team members toured Interstate Resources’ United Corrstack pulp mill – a mill that accepts paper coffee cups as a part of a larger mix of inputs (the primary feedstock for the mill is OCC). The goal of the trip was to see first-hand how the process works and how foodservice packaging fits as an input for their end-products.<br>

                <h5>Pret A Manger Post-Consumer Material Passes WMU Recyclability and Repulpability Test for Brown Tissue Applications</h5><p>At the 2012 TAPPI PEERS conference, Global Green and Western Michigan University presented the results of the first recyclability and repulpability test with post-consumer material using WMU's newly developed protocol to assess a material's usability as an input for tissue and towel applications. The post-consumer paper foodservice packaging passed the test, indicating that it could be a valuable input for manufacturing brown tissue products. This helps to support the case that this material could be diverted from landfills in larger quantities, and utilized as an input for new paper products.</p><br>
                <h5>Global Green Releases Pret A Manger Waste Characterization Results</h5><p>Approximately one year after the deployment of Pret A Manger's pioneering front- and back-of-house system for composting and recycling, Global Green undertook a waste characterization to assess the program's success. The findings detail the stream quality and capture rates of the four-stream front-of-house bin system, which includes paper recycling, plastic and aluminum recycling, food scraps, and trash, as well as Pret's back-of-house food donation, recycling and composting programs. For more detail, CoRR members can download the full report <a href='http://www.thecorr.org/members/PretWasteCharacterization2012_ReportandAppendix.pdf'>here</a>. The Executive Summary, including key findings, is available to the public <a href= 'http://www.thecorr.org/PretWasteCharacterization_ExecutiveSummary.pdf'>here</a>.</p><br>
                <p>Using the data collected through the waste characterization, Global Green also developed an analysis of the greenhouse gas impacts of composting all paper packaging as opposed to collecting it separately for recycling. For the results of the analysis, <a href= 'http://www.thecorr.org/GHGScenarioAnalysis_RecyclingandComposting.pdf'>click here</a>.</p><br>

                <h5>Pret A Manger Launches First Recycling Pilot to Go Beyond the Cup</h5><p>Pret A Manger launched a 3-store, eight week pilot to recycle its sandwich and salad boxes, soup containers, coffee cups, and bottles and cans. While recycling coffee cups and beverage containers previously have been piloted, this is the first pilot to recycle a range of paper food packaging items.</p><br><img src='img/color_sorting.jpg' style='right:11px;width:500px;position:relative;'><br><br>
                <p>Pret A Manger worked with Western Michigan University to pre-screen its salad and sandwich boxes, soup/oatmeal containers and lids, and coffee cups for recyclability and repulpability with respect to Old Corrugated Cardboard. Working with Clean River, Pret A Manger developed a three bin recycling system for paper packaging, metals and plastics, and trash. Materials are collected by Action Carting. For future pilots, Pret A Manger hopes to include more paper packaging types, and compost kitchen food waste.</p><br><p>Please visit one of the participating Manhattan stores at: Union Square (857 Broadway (@17th St), 135 W 50th St between 6th & 7th Ave, 101 Maiden Lane @ Pearl St.</p><br><p><a href='http://thecorr.org/FAQ_pretpilot.pdf'>For more information, please download frequently asked questions for the pilot.</a></p><br>

With recyclable coated boxes, restaurateurs and grocers don’t have to hide wax boxes in the corrugated bale or pay money for them to be hauled away. Many retailers such 
                as <a href='https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Wal-Mart:+the+new+jolly+green+giant-a0148008351'>Wal-Mart</a> and <a href='http://www.thecorr.org/poultry-cs.pdf'>Albertsons</a> are already doing just that, and are experiencing great results in both box performance and cost savings.</p><h4>Upcoming trials</h4><p>Global Green will be continuing our recyclable box pilot series, in which a variety of produce and seafood products will be transported from their packing locations to a retail location in recyclable packaging. The trials will be publicized to raise awareness regarding the relative benefits of recyclable packaging compared to non-recyclable alternatives. All CoRR members with FBA-certified recyclable wholesale 
                packaging are invited to participate. For more information about the program, please click here. To find out how to have your product included in the trial, please contact Lily Kelly at 415-697-0399 or <a href='mailto:lkelly@globalgreen.org'>lkelly@globalgreen.org.</a></p><h4>Success Stories</h4><h5>Greener Recyclable Cabbage Boxes Succeed After 750-Mile Journey</h5><p>Global Green worked with one of the nation’s largest grocers to test recyclable boxes that could be used by their suppliers across the country. The grocer operates over 1,300 locations, so if they decide to switch to 100% recyclable packaging that would make a tremendous impact. CoRR members <a href='http://www.gbp.com/'>Green Bay Packaging</a> and <a href='https://www.dssmith.com/us/packaging'>Interstate Container</a> provided several pallets of samples of 
                recyclable cabbage boxes to the cabbage packing facility in Moultrie, Georgia, where the cabbage was packed and shipped successfully to St. Louis. <a href='https://www.globalgreen.org/blog/'>Read More</a>.</p><h5>Greener Packaging for Boston: Global Green USA and NAFCO Successfully Test Recyclable Seafood Boxes</h5>
                <p>Global Green USA, building on previous successful recyclable packaging tests, came to the heart of New England for the next installment of the pilot series. With the help of a grocer and one of their primary seafood suppliers, Global Green USA documented the ice-packing of water-resistant, recyclable boxes made by <a href='https://www.cascades.com/en/'>Cascades</a> and <a href='https://www.dssmith.com/us/packaging'>Interstate Container</a> and shipped to a location in Boston, just in time for the last day of the Boston Seafood Expo on March 18th. 
                As the boxes were unloaded, all present confirmed that they had performed well, indicating that future shipments could also be sent in the strong, water-resistant, recyclable packaging. <a href='https://www.globalgreen.org/blog/'>Read More</a>.</p><h5>4 Years Later: Recyclable Boxes Still Saving Money & Reducing Emissions</h5><p>In 2010, Global Green USA's Coalition for Resource Recovery (CoRR) worked to pilot and document the use of recyclable corrugated boxes made by CoRR member <a href='https://www.dssmith.com/us/packaging'>Interstate Container</a> and used by Mountaire Farms, a poultry producer that operates the largest poultry processing facility in North America. The process led to the conversion of the facility to 100% corrugated packaging in 2010, which helped inspire <a href='http://www.thecorr.org/0112_recyclablepoultrypkgcorrpressrelease.pdf'>others to follow 
                suit</a> in subsequent years. Since 2010, Mountaire Farms has also converted their other two processing facilities over to recyclable corrugated containers. <a href='https://www.globalgreen.org/blog/'>Read more</a>.</p><h5>Green Packaging in the Big Easy: Global Green USA's Coalition for Resource Recovery Tests Recyclable Seafood Boxes</h5><p>New Orleans seafood is going green. Global Green USA’s Coalition for Resource Recovery (CoRR) joined forces this past week with the New Orleans Fish House to test recyclable coated corrugated boxes as methods of transporting locally caught seafood. These innovative boxes, made by CoRR members Cascades Industrial Packaging and Interstate Container, are designed to be recyclable, unlike the paraffin-coated packaging typically used, and also withstand 
                the icy seafood packing process. <a href='http://www.thecorr.org/GGUSA_RecyclableSeafoodBoxPilot_PressRelease.pdf'>Read More</a>.</p><h5>Video Released Detailing Results of 2012 Recyclable Box Pilots in CA and NJ</h5><iframe width='420' height='290' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBoJJEjUSUQ' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen style='position:relative;left:27px;'></iframe>
                <br><br><p>Global Green USA released a video detailing the promising results of their 2012 pilots to test recyclable produce boxes that are designed to withstand wet cooling processes.For the pilots, Global Green USA teamed up with members of CoRR to test alternatives to paraffin-coated produce boxes, which cannot be recycled and are a contaminant within bales of uncoated cardboard. 
                Boxes were tested with a variety of wet cooling processes in California and New Jersey and the results show that many box products with recyclable coatings are robust enough to withstand vacuum cooling, hydro-vac, and some hydro-cooling processes.</p><h5>Global Green USA Kicks Off Pilot Series in Santa Cruz, California</h5><p>In April 2012, recyclable produce box trials commenced in honor of Earth Day at New Leaf Community Market’s flagship store in Santa Cruz, California. The event took place in the heart of a major farming region for leafy greens, which are commonly packed in unrecyclable boxes. The produce was provided by local farm Lakeside Organic Gardens, and the latest in 
                commercially available Fibre Box Association certified recyclable boxes were supplied by members of Global Green USA’s Coalition for Resource Recovery (CoRR), Green Bay Packaging and Interstate Container. <a href='http://globalgreen.org/blogs/global/?p=3935'>Read More</a>.</p><h5>Mountaire Farms & Interstate Container Convert Largest US Poultry Plant to Recyclable, Wax-Alternative Boxes</h5><p>In 2009, founder’s circle member, Interstate Container, and its business partner, Mountaire, announced its plans to conduct field trials on boxes used to ship poultry through wholesale channels. Interstate and Mountaire Farms conducted multiple trials 
                on boxes shipped through Hunt’s Point. Trials began pallet by pallet through Hunt’s Point’s harsh conditions and progressed to the truck load, and more recently a two week test shipping where Mountaire product shipped solely in the FBA-certified recyclable and compostable boxes.<br><br>If all of the newly designed boxes were recycled, the greenhouse gas benefit from source reduction and recycling the boxes would be 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. In addition, the switch from ice-packed poultry to modified atmosphere packaging is estimated to save millions of gallons of water annually. Combined, these innovations also improve efficiency, streamline operations, and provide a safer work environment.</p><br><iframe width='390' height='280' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ncyp4pc6-1s' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen style='position:relative;left:40px;'></iframe>">

Over 34 million tons of food waste is generated in the US each year. Less then 5% of te food waste is currently recovered.
                Diverting this food waste from landfills would result in the avoidance of more than 23 million metric tons of CO2 equivilance each year, the same as taking 7 million cars off the road. Urban areas face particular challenges in deploying food waste recovery solutions given a number of factors, including: the quantity of waste, the lack of availability of sufficient land area to treat it, land values, zoning ordinances, potential alterations to trucking routes,
                and the need for much more robust end-markets if solutions are to be scaled up.">

                <br>Over 100 million yards, or approximately a billion pounds of spent carpet is annually removed in New York City and the surrounding region.Currently, non-reclaimed or recycled carpet is diverted to landfills that are at an average distance of over 400 miles, or are burned in regional incinerators.<br>
                <h4>Solution</h4><br><p>Capturing spent carpet within a short distance of its removal and submitting it to proven deconstruction, separation, cleaning and recycling application technologies in a central location with truck and barge access will eliminate a shipping distance involving two to four transfers and lost transit time, pipeline inventories, and an inequitable cost- equivalent-to-value ratio.
                  There are more than a dozen logical sites for establishing a carpet recycling facility within New York City. A typical location under study is the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where Building 128 is slated for tenant refurbishing utilizing State and City grant funds totaling $17 million, with the BNY targeting “green” light industry opportunities.</p><h4>Current Successful Technologies</h4><br>

										<p>While NYC has a wide variety of food donation options, it is still common for hotels and venues of large events to send any edible food waste to landfills – particularly following large events.
                        Effie Worldwide, Inc. teamed with Global Green USA, Rescuing Leftover Cuisine, and Food Cowboy to donate over 120 pounds of unserved food from its 47th Annual North American Effie Awards Gala held June 4 at Cipriani 42nd Street to the New York City Rescue Mission, with Uber donating the transportation.
                          Global Green’s Coalition for Resource Recovery member Food Cowboy initiated Limo for the Leftovers, a program which uses mobile technology to help address the logistical challenges for venues and caterers to donate surplus food to food banks and soup kitchens.
